People sometimes write code like this when they want to handle the asynchronous error by invoking the callback function and passing the error as an argument. But they make the mistake of thinking that if they throw it from their own callback (the function passed to doSomeAsynchronousOperation), then it can be caught in the catch block. That's not how try/catch work with asynchronous functions. Recall that the whole point of an asynchronous function is that it's invoked some time later, after myApiFunc returns. That means the try block has been exited. The callback is invoked directly by Node, with no try block around it. So if you use this anti-pattern, you'll end up crashing the program when you throw the error. Event in the case of an explicit async function that uses an await in the try block, an error thrown asynchronously won't be caught. Below is an example of an error that won't be caught.
